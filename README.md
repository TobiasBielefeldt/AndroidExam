# Project description
Waterapp is an app where you can keep a small list of the plants you have in your home. The app will then be able to give you information about the plant such as its origins and how much sun/water it needs. But most importantly you will be able to select when you last watered a plant and the app will then keep track of when the plant should be watered again.
 
## Requirements:
- Fragment. The app will support a list of plants and a screen with details about a chosen plant. Like the shopping list app.
- Local storage. Database support for saving your plants and their last watering time.
- Room. External library will be used to store information about personal plants.
- Firebase. Web service call to see the amount of a specific plant among users.
- Glide. External library will be used to get images of the plants.
