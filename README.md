# Project description
Waterapp is an app where you can keep a small list of the plants you have in your home. The app will then be able to give you information about the plant such as its origins and how much sun/water it needs. But most importantly you will be able to select that you have just watered a plant and the app will then keep track of when the plant should be watered again.
